						Howdy! I'm a software engineer professionally and a tech enthusiast by hobby. Once upon a time y'all could find me in Pittsburgh, but nowadays I'm based out of Austin.
						I've worked across a variety of industries, and I love teaching people how to write code. I still remember how magical it felt the first time programing clicked for me,
						and I enjoy being able to facilitate a similar experience for others.

					<p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
						I don't really have any goals or plans for this blog. I like writing, and I'm not particularly active on social media.
						So this blog my space (not MySpace) to shout into the void of the internet.
					</p>
					<p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
						Outside of technology, I enjoy many things, especially lists, so let me make just that:
						cooking, cookware, cutlury; cleaning; coffee; fermenting kombucha; comic books; board games; video games; world building and fantasy settings;
						reading; history; spirituality; walking; hiking; photography
