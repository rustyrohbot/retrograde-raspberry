January's already halfway through, and I'm still here wondering how 2025 flew by so quickly.

So what have I been up to? 

I demolished and rebuilt a deck. Only replacing the rotted boards quickly turned into most of the planks needed replaced. Who knew installing railings and stairs were so hard. But obviously leagues easier than centering a div though, now that's real engineering.

Began the work of turning an overrun green space by the creek into a creek. Learned how to use a chainsaw and machete. Quickly learned how valuable a wheelbarrow is. 

I moved up to Dallas, I gotta say, it kinda feels like a giant suburb. The parks are flat playgrounds with a paved walking trail. The stuff to do is shopping centers in the form of strip malls and plazas. On the bright side, pretty easy place to be a hermit. And the pace of life here is pretty comfortable. 

Between all the cities now, Pittsburgh keeps its crown, despite the existence of winters.

Left the small fintech firm, now back to working for a large bank with enough employees to fill the city of Harrisburg. 

Overall though, not much has changed, still an unhinged man on the internet from the One Star State. 

I kicked off the new year by injuring myself and ending up in the hospital. Off to a great start. Obviously the worst thing to happen around the start of 2026.

Then wrote a short book, [pROHject Management](http://prohjectmanagement.com/). Freely available to the public, served on the world wide web.

Not sure what the rest of the year has in store.
